  <h1>We believe weddings are felt, not staged.</h1>

  <p>
    Every wedding carries its own rhythm — quiet moments,
    overwhelming emotions, fleeting details.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our role is simple: to observe, to anticipate, and to document
    your day as it naturally unfolds.

        <h2>How We Work</h2>

        <div class="work-points">
        <p>
        On a wedding day, our presence is calm and unobtrusive.
        We observe quietly, allowing moments to unfold naturally
        without constant direction.
        </p>

        <p>
        When guidance is needed, it’s gentle and minimal —
        enough to keep things flowing, never enough to interrupt
        what’s real.
        </p>

        <p>
        Our focus is always on making you feel comfortable and present,
        so you can experience your day fully, without performing for the camera.

  <h2>Our Approach</h2>

  <p>
    Rather than chasing trends or recreating what already exists,
    we focus on context, connection, and restraint.
  </p>

  <p>
    The way people move through a space.
    The pause before a smile.
    The moments that are easy to miss when you’re rushing.
  </p>

  <p>
    These details shape how a wedding is remembered —
    not as a collection of images,
    but as a complete, honest story.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="about-cta">
  <h2>Let’s Talk</h2>

  <p>
    If our approach resonates with you, we’d love to hear about
    your plans and what matters most to you.
